# OPCovid-BR
The OPCovid-Br consists of an opinion mining system for fine-grained opinion and polarity classification of Covid-19 twitter data in Portuguese language.

We created machine learning classifiers for fine-grained opinion and polarity classification tasks using twitter data on the Covid-19 in Brazilian Portuguese language. We extracted 600 twitters during the pandemic and annotated the fine-grained opinion for each twitter as well as the binary document polarity (positive or negative). We named the new created dataset for OPCovid-BR. Subsequently, we trained machine learning-based classifiers using different methods for each task. For polarity classification, we tested a cross-domain strategy in order to measure the performance of the classifiers among different domains. For fine-grained opinion identification, we proposed a taxonomy of opinion aspect and employed them in conjunction with the machine learning methods. Based on the obtained results, we found that the cross-domain data improved the results of the polarity classification and for fine-grained opinion identification, the use of a domain taxonomy presented competitive results to fine-grained opinion identification of twitter data.
